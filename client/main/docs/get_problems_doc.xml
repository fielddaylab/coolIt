<Problem Name="Minesweeper I" ID="1">
    <Description>A mine sweeper being developed by the US Navy uses a Magnesium DiBoride superconducting magnet that must be cooled to 25 K in order to operate reliably. Power constraints on the ship limit the power consumed by the cryocooler to less than 20 kW. The 0.5 m diameter by 1.0 m tall magnet that weighs 250 kg is to be mounted on a support cylinder inside a cylindrical vessel that has maximum inside dimensions of 0.6 m diameter by 1.5 m length. The flexible current leads that provide electric current to the magnet add a constant 50-watt heat load on the cryocooler. Determine a low cost support system for the superconducting magnet. The navy is offering $10,000 for a valid solution to this problem.</Description>
