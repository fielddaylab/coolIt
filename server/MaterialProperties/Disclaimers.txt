Using data from the NIST site, some materials have a thermal conductivity data range which ends below 300K.
All of those data ranges have been extrapolated to 300K as the simulation cannot proceed without this data.
Affected materials are:

	Aluminum 6063 T5	(295)
	Beryllium Copper	(120)
	Brass				(110)
	Kevlar 49			(200)
	Lead				(295)
	Platinum			(295)
	Mylar				(80)
